## What is JSON
[Chapter 6 of Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html) introduced JSON as part of the discussion on Objects and Data. JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, and it is the syntax used to create a JavaScript Object.  

For example a nice simple little cat object might be:

{% highlight js %}
{
	"name": "Kyo",
	"age": 9,
	"breed": "Tabby",
	"color": "orange"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that this is a series of name and value pairs separated by a colon : and all contained inside a set of curly braces {}.
