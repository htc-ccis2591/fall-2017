## ES6
JavaScript is based on the ECMA Script (ES) standard and the newest updates are found in ES6.  All of the standard is not yet widely available in browsers, meaning that if you want to use certain features of it you need to *transpile* your code into older JS syntax. (More on this later.) However some parts of the ES6 spec are well supported, at least in modern browsers.

### Can I Use
An interesting question is how do you know what is and isn't supported and by which browsers.  If you want to push the technology edge, this is a very important question.  Fortunately for the web, there is an awesome website called [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#home) which tracks support and usage statistics across the web.

Let's look at the support for the new features that we have or will be looking at:

- [Let](https://caniuse.com/#feat=let)
- [Const](https://caniuse.com/#feat=const)
- [Template Literals](https://caniuse.com/#feat=template-literals)
- [Arrow Functions](https://caniuse.com/#feat=arrow-functions)
- [New Class Syntax](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-class)

### ECMA Script Compatability Table
The [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#home) site is useful for HTML, CSS, & JS features, but there is also a site dedicated more specifically to all of the ES6 features: [ECMA Script Compatability Table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).  

If you really want to dive into specific features, this is a better site, as not all the features are included yet on Can I Use.  However, that might also be a good indicator that it is perhaps not yet stable enough of a feature.  (Opinions on that will vary...)

## New Features
The new features will not be covered in detail here.  Please read about them using the following links:
