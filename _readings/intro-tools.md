summary: "An overview of the tools that we will be using for this course."

# {{ page.title }}
You're learning to be a true IT professional, and to do this, you must learn to work with real tools:

- a professional text editor
- web browsers and their developer tools
- the command line, terminal, or shell
- file & version management
- JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS3


## Professional Editor
You'll also need a text editor, something like MS Word for programming.  A professional editor includes tools that make writing code easier, things like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and indenting blocks of text.  The editor recommended for this course is called [Brackets](https://brackets.io/), and it was made by the people at Adobe. It is a popular tool for web development due to its built in web server (NodeJS) which allows you to live preview your web pages.

The core of Brackets is a basic text editor with some code smart features.  To make our lives easier, we will extend it with some add-ons specific to the work that we will be doing.  As you learn to work with Brackets, feel free to look for additional extensions to suit your own personal likes and needs.


## Web Browsers
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) is the main browser that we will use for this course, and is required for the Live Preview feature in Brackets. Demonstrations of the browser developer tools will also be done using Chrome.  

While, it is a good practice to test your site in all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, IE/Edge (Windows), and Safari (Apple), as well as on a variety of mobile device browsers. We will not focus on cross-browser testing or issues. However we will discuss HTML5 backwards compatibility and cross-browser issues briefly, at a high-level.


## The shell
As a typical computer user, you interact with a graphical view of the system presented by your operating system.  However, underneath this is more direct and barebones interface to your operating system, the shell. The shell allows us to navigate files, alter permissions, execute system tasks, and build and run the programs we will be developing. On a Windows computer this is PowerShell. On an Apple computer, it's Terminal. Generically it is called the shell. The shell is the IT professional's lifeblood; embrace it. The sooner you get comfortable with it, the easier your IT life will be.


## File & Version Management
Configuration files and code are important assets to an organization. Likewise the files you create as part of this course are important assets to you. We will be learning to manage these files professionally using a source code management tool called git which maintains versions of files inside of a repository and [GitHub](https://github.com/) a free, public cloud hosting service for your git repositories.

If you do not already have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, please visit the website to register for a free public account now. You should select a professional account or username, for example my user name is mbmosman - my initials and last name.  You are not required to have it be your real name, but it should be recognizable and readable. (Please __DO NOT__ use your school ID or Star ID.) If you use your student email, you can later request a free Personal account upgrade through the GitHub [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).


## JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS3
JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in use today. It originated back in 1995 to add basic programming capabilities into web pages, and it has come a *long* way since then. Today it is vital to the functionality of many (dare I say most) websites. It is also becoming popular outside of the web pages themselves as a *back-end* or *sever-side* language as well through the use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and in databases such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

It's expected that you are familiar with HTML & CSS already, so we will not be spending a lot of time with learning HTML & CSS in this course. However we will be using HTML & CSS as part of our web assignments while working with JavaScript.
