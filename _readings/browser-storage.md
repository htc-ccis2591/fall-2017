## Cookies
You have likely heard of browser cookies. Cookies are the *older* way of storing information, but were widely used (for good & evil) before HTML5. Because many security conscious people are cautious about cookies, disabling them or clearing them on a regular basis, developers are moving toward new options for storing data made available in the [W3C Web Storage Specification]( http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-storage-interface ).
