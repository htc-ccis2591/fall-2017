## Prerequisites
Make sure that you have completed the following prerequisites before beginning:

- [GitHub Basics]( {{ "/readings/intro-github-basics.html" | prepend:site.baseurl }} )  
- [GitHub: JS Hello World]({{ "/experiences/intro-hello-world.html" | prepend:site.baseurl }})


## Summarize the workflow
Write a document to outline and summarize, __in your own words__ (don't just copy mine), the steps for completing an assignment on GitHub.  Begin with how to accept the assignment and get the starter files from GitHub.  You should end with putting the screenshot of your GitHub pull-request in the D2L Brightspace Assignment box.

    content="Remember that you have access to MS Word through Office 365 as an HTC student.  You can use it on the web or by downloading and installing on your home computer."
%}

When finished, put the completed MS Word or PDF document in the assignment Dropbox for this module.

{% include alert.html type="danger"
    content="Any files types that I am unable to read when grading will receive __no credit__ for the assignment.  It is strongly recommended that you use a current version of MS Word or a program that will generate a standard Adobe PDF file."
